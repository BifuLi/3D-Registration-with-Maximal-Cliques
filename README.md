## Build
MAC depends on [PCL](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/tags) (`>= 1.10.1`) and [igraph](https://github.com/igraph/igraph/tags)(`=0.9.9`). Please install these libraries first.

To build PLADE, you need [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (`>= 3.23`) and, of course, a compiler that supports `>= C++11`. The code in this repository has been tested on Windows (MSVC `=2022` `x64`), and Linux (GCC `=10.4.0`). Machines nowadays typically provide higher [support](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support), so you should be able to build MAC on almost all platforms.
